## how to use branches
The repository default branch is 'release'.

The 'master' branch is kept for backwards compatibility and should NOT be modified.

All changes are first published to the release branch.

There is one branch for each dependent application, e.g. 'blesensor_4.17'. Please note that this branch will be used by all BLE Sensor app versions 4.17.0, 4.17.1, 4.17.2 etc.

Whenever a new major version of the app is published, a new branch will be created, e.g. blesensor_4.18, blesensor_5.0, etc.
